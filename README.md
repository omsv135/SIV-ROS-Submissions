# Siv-ROS assignment submition

THE folder shared contains the ROS program for a image_process package that has three nodes communicating via 2 topics in a linear fashion to :
a) Take the image input from the webcam
b) Crop the image by 30% in size
c) Show the image in a terminal

A launch file (image_cropping.launch) can be used to launch all the nodes at once .

OpenCV was used for the programming of the nodes along with rospy
